# Code Usage
We strongly recommend you to use .ipynb file to do experiments. You can run all cells in order to see the experiment results and some parts of the experiments are required to run several times. It depends. You can refer to the comment of the code, which will tell you the tunable variables and where the experiments start and end.

The executable python file is runnable, but it is hard to run in a flexible way.

## Running environment
* tensorflow 1.3.0
* keras 2.1.5
* numpy
